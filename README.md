# A Survey of Visual Analytics Tools for Effective Decision-Making

In this project, we will conduct a thorough lay-of-the-land survey of systems literature in visual analytics and visualization in order to identify visual analytics techniques that have been demonstrated to support decisionmaking. This survey will focus in particular on visualization techniques that have been tested in operationally-relevant contexts (e.g. cybersecurity, etc.). For each system surveyed, we will collect information on the following dimensions:

 - D1: Visualization techniques used
 - D2: Interaction techniques used
 - D3: Statistical or ML techniques used
 - D4: Data type
 - D5: Data volume
 - D6: Stated analytical goal (what is the system supposed to help an analyst do?)
 - D7: Was the system effective at achieving that goal?
 - D8: Validation method (how did we arrive at that conclusion?)
 - D9: Single vs multi user
 - D10: Year findings were published
 - D11: How was the system designed? (coded using the following model: Munzner, Tamara. "A nested model for visualization design and validation." Visualization and Computer Graphics, IEEE Transactions on 15.6 (2009): 921-928.)

Having collected and coded information on the 11 dimensions described in above, we will then apply standard clustering techniques to identify groups of related approaches. In particular, we will focus on the relationships between the techniques used (D1-3) and the analytical goals/context (D4-6). This will be used to define a taxonomy of approaches that have have had demonstrated success, and the conditions under which that success was achieved.

Using this taxonomy, we will then develop a set of actionable guidelines for the design of future systems. For each of the
contexts we that have been explored in the surveyed literature, we will provide recommendations regarding the selection of visual analytics techniques that are shown to be effective.
